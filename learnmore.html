        <h3> Our Story</h3>
        <p>In 2019, we began our business by solely renting PCs. We also sell high-quality computer
            accessories such as monitors, headphones, mice, and gaming chairs. That same year, we also began
            providing printing services. We also offer a True Money service, which includes e-load, bill
            payment, and cash shipment. We closed our cafe in 2020 to ensure our safety after the pandemic
            began. After four months, we resumed operations and began offering online deliveries.</p>
        <p>In 2022, we organized a mini-tournament for the Special Forces participants. This mini-tournament
            also includes cash prizes for the top three teams. We now have a branch in Brgy. Iyam, Lucena City.
            In 2024, we will continue to operate and sell high-quality computer peripherals and printers, as
            well as printing services, true money, and sticker customization.</p>
